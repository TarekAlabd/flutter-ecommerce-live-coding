# Flutter E-commerce App

This is an e-commerce app built with Flutter & Dart,  built (and still working on it) in this [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vtyWBHY2NXpW_Hazx7jCYqwVlwe7SYk).

## Why does this playlist exist?

The main reason for this playlist is to simulate a part of the process we take with our teams to build a mobile application, we need to plan for the project, decide on how we will handle the state management, routing approaches, theming and so on, writing the code and after that refactoring it after seeing a better approach to do something or after code reviewing.
